# Facebook-Clone - Still In Work
I want to create Facebook clone to practice Front-end skills and learn Back-end.

For now I created only Facebook structure using HTML and CSS. Web is static, there are now JavaScript yet. 
First I need to learn database, backend technology and how to connect Front-end with Back-end. Then I need some data to work with and make website dynamic.
